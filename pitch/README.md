*Lens Model Sensor Integration: Implementation of a Social Signal Processing System in a Robotic Platform*

=====================================

### Topic:
This document introduces a proposal for a novel social-cognitive robotic system for implementation in military contexts. The system proposed herein informs the design of an attributional mechanism that leverages the coupling of a passive infrared sensor with the Lens Model Equation (LME; Cooksey, 1996; Doherty & Kurz, 1996; Hammond, 1993; Vicente, 2003; Wiltshire et al., 2014) to facilitate direct comparison of two systems: the ecological social environment and the cognitive processes utilized in decision making during a mental state attribution task.  

=====================================

 ### Rationale & Benefits
The modern combat environment has evolved over time such that soldiers are now required to be capable of making increasingly complex judgments when it comes to tracking and identifying other humans (Bourlai, 2013). Given this, it stands to reason that soldiers engage in the attribution of mental states (i.e., emotions, intentions, beliefs) while engaged in these tasks. However, humans are prone to error throughout the decision-making process, which is why this document proposes a robotic system capable of removing human error from the equation.

=====================================

### Proposed Simulation(s)

***Plan A (simple)***

This plan involves the creation of a simulation designed to model the Lens Model Equation and its ability to accurately predict threats or identify individuals in distress.



***Plan B (complex)***

In addition to creating the simulation described in the previous section, this plan would also incorporate a simulation designed to generate infrared signatures and temperature distribution data correlating to models of objects in a real-world environment, under social contexts, to simulate infrared sensor performance.
